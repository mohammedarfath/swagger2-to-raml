# swagger2-to-raml
This tool has been created to convert Swagger 2 YAML specs to RAML 0.8.

## Installation

### Node 

Dependencies:

* node >= 0.10
* npm >= 2.0.0

```bash
npm install swagger2toraml --save
```

## Usage

S22RAML usage is very simple, it just needs a path or a set of paths of Swagger 2 YAML files and one folder path to save 
the RAML files.

### Single file

```js
var converter = require('swagger2-to-raml');
S22RAML('./path/to/swagger2/yaml/file.yaml', './raml');
``` 

### Array of files

```js
var converter = require('swagger2-to-raml');
S22RAML([ 
		'./path/to/swagger2/yaml/files/first.yaml', 
		'./path/to/swagger2/yaml/files/second.yaml'
	], './raml');
``` 

To get more information I recommend to read the use cases in tests.

## Tests

To run the tests with NodeUnit:

```bash
npm install
npm test
```
